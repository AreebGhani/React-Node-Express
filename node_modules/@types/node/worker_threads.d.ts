/**
 * The `worker_threads` module enables the use of threads that execute JavaScript
 * in parallel. To access it:
 *
 * ```js
 * const worker = require('worker_threads');
 * ```
 *
 * Workers (threads) are useful for performing CPU-intensive JavaScript operations.
 * They do not help much with I/O-intensive work. The Node.js built-in
 * asynchronous I/O operations are more efficient than Workers can be.
 *
 * Unlike `child_process` or `cluster`, `worker_threads` can share memory. They do
 * so by transferring `ArrayBuffer` instances or sharing `SharedArrayBuffer`instances.
 *
 * ```js
 * const {
 *   Worker, isMainThread, parentPort, workerData
 * } = require('worker_threads');
 *
 * if (isMainThread) {
 *   module.exports = function parseJSAsync(script) {
 *     return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
 *       const worker = new Worker(__filename, {
 *         workerData: script
 *       });
 *       worker.on('message', resolve);
 *       worker.on('error', reject);
 *       worker.on('exit', (code) => {
 *         if (code !== 0)
 *           reject(new Error(`Worker stopped with exit code ${code}`));
 *       });
 *     });
 *   };
 * } else {
 *   const { parse } = require('some-js-parsing-library');
 *   const script = workerData;
 *   parentPort.postMessage(parse(script));
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * The above example spawns a Worker thread for each `parseJSAsync()` call. In
 * practice, use a pool of Workers for these kinds of tasks. Otherwise, the
 * overhead of creating Workers would likely exceed their benefit.
 *
 * When implementing a worker pool, use the `AsyncResource` API to inform
 * diagnostic tools (e.g. to provide asynchronous stack traces) about the
 * correlation between tasks and their outcomes. See `"Using AsyncResource for a Worker thread pool"` in the `async_hooks` documentation for an example implementation.
 *
 * Worker threads inherit non-process-specific options by default. Refer to `Worker constructor options` to know how to customize worker thread options,
 * specifically `argv` and `execArgv` options.
 * @see [source](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/v18.0.0/lib/worker_threads.js)

         *
         * In particular, the significant differences to `JSON` are:

         * * `value` may contain circular references.
         * * `value` may contain instances of builtin JS types such as `RegExp`s,`BigInt`s, `Map`s, `Set`s, etc.
         * * `value` may contain typed arrays, both using `ArrayBuffer`s
         * and `SharedArrayBuffer`s.
         * * `value` may contain [`WebAssembly.Module`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/WebAssembly/Module) instances.
         * * `value` may not contain native (C++-backed) objects other than:
         *
         * ```js
         * const { MessageChannel } = require('worker_threads');
         * const { port1, port2 } = new MessageChannel();

         *
         * `transferList` may be a list of [`ArrayBuffer`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/ArrayBuffer), `MessagePort` and `FileHandle` objects.
         * After transferring, they are not usable on the sending side of the channel
         * anymore (even if they are not contained in `value`). Unlike with `child processes`, transferring handles such as network sockets is currently
         * not supported.
         *
         * If `value` contains [`SharedArrayBuffer`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/SharedArrayBuffer) instances, those are accessible

         * port2.postMessage(uint8Array);
         * // This does not copy data, but renders `uint8Array` unusable:
         * port2.postMessage(uint8Array, [ uint8Array.buffer ]);
         *
         * // The memory for the `sharedUint8Array` is accessible from both the
         * // original and the copy received by `.on('message')`:
         * const sharedUint8Array = new Uint8Array(new SharedArrayBuffer(4));
         * port2.postMessage(sharedUint8Array);
         *
         * // This transfers a freshly created message port to the receiver.
         * // This can be used, for example, to create communication channels between
